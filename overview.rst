Welcome to introduction
==================================

Azkaban was implemented at LinkedIn to solve the problem of Hadoop job dependencies. We had jobs that needed to run in order, from ETL jobs to data analytics products.

Initially a single server solution, with the increased number of Hadoop users over the years, Azkaban has evolved to be a more robust solution.

Azkaban consists of 3 key components:

- Relational Database (MySQL)
- AzkabanWebServer
- AzkabanExecutorServer
